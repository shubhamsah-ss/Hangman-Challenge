# Hangman Challenge
- create a greeting
- create your word list
- create an empty list
- randomly choose a word from the list you have created
- for each letter in the secret_word add a "_" that will be printed to the console
- **Example:** if the word is Hacker "\_","\_","\_","\_","\_","\_"
- ask the user to guess a letter
- **bonus** make the program take the input from the user and make it lowercase
- Loop through each of the letters in the chosen word
- if the letter is in the word replace the "_" with the letter
- display the guessed word after every guess
- it should look like this "\_","a","c","\_","\_","r"
- use a while loop so your game keeps going until the word has been guessed
- create a variable as an int starting at 0 and when it gets to the number 5 the game ends
- add a print statement tell the user they get 5 guesses
